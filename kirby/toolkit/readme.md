# Kirby Toolkit

The Kirby 2 toolkit is a set of handy classes and helpers which make your life with PHP easier.

## Beta

**Kirby 2 and all its components are still in beta. Please note that this version is not yet built for production. It's a developer preview. We cannot give support for the beta or sell licenses for it. Please purchase a (link: http://getkirby.com text: Kirby 1) license and use Kirby 1's source code while Kirby 2 is still in development. There will be a free upgrade once Kirby 2 has launched.**
