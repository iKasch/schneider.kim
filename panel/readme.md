# Kirby Panel

The Kirby Panel is a open-source interface for your Kirby installation.

## Beta

**Kirby 2, the panel and all its components are still in beta. Please note that this version is not yet built for production. It's a developer preview. We cannot give support for the beta or sell licenses for it. Please purchase a (link: http://getkirby.com text: Kirby 1) license and use Kirby 1's source code while Kirby 2 is still in development. There will be a free upgrade once Kirby 2 has launched.**

## Installation

We recommend to install the starterkit: https://github.com/getkirby/starterkit or boilerplate https://github.com/getkirby/boilerplate to get started. Both include the panel. If you want to add the panel to your plain Kirby installation afterwards, you can go for
