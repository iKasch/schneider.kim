  <h1>Hi, I'm Kim ðŸ‘‹</h1>
  <p>
    With more than {yearsOfExperience} years of development experience, I have gained expertise in full-stack
    engineering, web motion design, and leading sustainable teams while working in diverse industries
    and collaborating on a wide range of projects.

    I live in Hamburg, Germany, work for @MOIA and help out over at Post mit Herz. I also do
    Longboard Freestyle & Dance as a Teamrider for Studio Longboard. Feel free to write me an email
